# ToDo list App
Todo List application using Javascript

## What is this project?
This project is a ToDo list, created using the basic course offered on [watch and code](watchandcode.com) webpage to learn Javascript.

## What is the main purpose of this project?
Although a ToDo list is the basic project for almost every language and every framework available on the web, I haven't made one yet. so this particular project is aimed more as a personal project, even a portfolio case more than an usable product (it's going to be 100% to be usable, but as I said there are a lot of todo apps out there).

## Which technologies are involved in this project?
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* Javascript

That's it!!
